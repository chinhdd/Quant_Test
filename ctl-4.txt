**3. Describe each of their work flow: WHAT are they responsible for? WHEN, WHERE and WHAT do they work?**

    [Answer] 
	There are many activities in whole sale process, but we can gather it to three group activities as below.
	- Pre-sale activities (marked as PS)
	- Sale activities (marked as SL)
	- Post-sale activities (marked as PO)
	
	We will describe detail work of each person mapping to each activity process.
	# Pre-sale activities (PS)
	
	We assume that there is a long list of prospect customers which might be the result of marketting department. It must contain some information about customer as below.
	1. Organization name
    2. Organization type (one of nine types described above, those are finance & legal, car & automotive, public sector, health care, energy, IT & telecoms, manufacturing, media & TV and transport)
	3. Organization address
	4. At least one contact person in the organization
	5. Person's contact information such as name, gender, phone number, email.
	List of prospect customers should be inputed before sale activities.

	* Sale director
		1. Set sale target for each sale branch, it might contain the number of sale closing (or the number of deal), the total volume value of sale (it equals to sum of volume in each closing sale). The sale target may depend on the number of sale employee in each branch and it contains duration time such as one month, one quarter or one year.
		2. Distribute list of all prospect customer to all sale branches, usually depend on address of branch should be near to address of customer's organization.
		
	* Sale 	manager
		1. Distribute list of all prospect customer in that branch to every sale representative. At first, he/she can distribute uniform the list to every sale representative without considering organization type. However, after some time working together, he/she may want to distribute the list to sale representatives which may be their advantage and they can sell with best effort and effectiveness.
		2. Set sale target for each of sale representative, it might contain the number of deal, the total sale volume. He or she can set different target for each sale representative or the same for all. The sale target duration is usually set up for one week, one month, one quarter or longer.
		3. Set the rule of selling. In this case we sell anti-virus software which might get directly from manufacturer or other reseller. As many items we sold, as more surplus percent we get. For example, by sold product under 200$, we get 10% of the total order; by sold product from 200$ to 500$, we get 20% of the total order; and sold product above 500$, we get 30% of the order. And for each sale closing contract, sale representative has to keep at least 50$ as the basic cost for calling, email, electricity, etc, the remaining is profit of company. All these rules should be defined in advance by sale manager.
		
	* Sale representative
		1. Receive their own list prospects and prioritize people follows their own opinion.
		2. Qualify the prospect customer by some approach
		- Send email to prospect to fill in form which has some questions to qualify their need and requirement.
		- Conduct a seminar about product and invite all prospects to attend and fill in form which has some questions to qualify their need and requirement.
		
		Some questions prepared should cover BANT criteria (Budget, Authority, Need, Timing)
		- Budget (B): How to know from prospect that there could be a budget created for anti-virus software or they have just made enterprise anti-virus software purchased in last few months.
		Some questions may be as below.
			+ Is there any anti-virus software used in your organization/company? Is it free version or paid version? (Y/N)
			+ Do you know the benefit of paid anti-virus software? Do your company plan to use paid version in next few months? (Y/N)
			+ If your company has already used paid anti-virus software, please tell me what is software name? (Text)
			+ If your company is using Kaspersky anti-virus paid version, could you tell me the expiration date? (Text)
		- Authority (A): There is at least one contact that is interested in solving the problem related to software security, maybe he is director or above. This kind of question usually should be asked while calling or meeting.

        For anti-virus software product, the customers always want to be best protected when they pay for use it. Because of that, we provide some reference to famous company whose business is quite the same and current using the software product. There are some companies as below.
        1. Finance & Legal: BRAC is the largest NGO in the world, it has number of employee nearly 120,000 people in 10 countries in Asia and Africa helping an estimated 138 million people to escape from poverty.
        2. Car & Automotive: LKQ is a fortune 500 business and North Ameria's largest supplier of a huge range of alternative replacement components for vehicle repairs. Its headquarter in Chicago, USA and it has 23,000 employees worldwide.
        And some more examples for each type of organization.

        One characteristic of anti-virus software is sometimes the customers don't know completely about the product they are using, how many features it covers and whether it is enough for their need. Sale representative should prepare for any customer's requirement if he/she ask while calling or meeting.
        
		All those questions can be input or modified by sale representative. After conducting a seminar, they have to update seminar result as well as prospect's information from gathering answers from them.
